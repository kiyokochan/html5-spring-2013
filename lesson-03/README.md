For this assignmnet I implemented the following CSS3 features: 
1. The h1,h2,h3 and h4 headings are using a font face from Google's web fonts, "Open Sans Condensed"
2. I added a text shadow to all text located in the header tag
3. Rounded corners can be found on the bottom of my "Aboout Me" section
4. Added a box shadow to my About Me section 

You can see my transition element by hovering over the "HTML5 IS AWESOME" box located under my self-description.
