Exercise: Convert an existing HTML page to proper semantic markup.  This can be a page that you have previously built for another class or project or any existing webpage.  Choose a page with a variety of different elements and opportunities to use a good selection of the new semantic tags.  Write about your tag choices and process, paying attention to areas where the choice of tags is ambiguous.
This was a great exercise to get my feet wet. I took a webpage I created for a previous class and attempted to update it with the new html5 tags. I updated the doctype, meta, link tags first. Then I updated my div nav tags to just nav tags and updated main content div to a section div. After these changes, I uploaded my file. To my surprise, the styles had all disappeared. I had a “duh!” moment and  updated the ids that were previously there, to the new HTML5 tags. Now they worked! And to be honest, I was pretty surprised that they worked; because this code is different from what I’m used to working with. 
Unfortunately, I didn’t have a lot of content to work with on this page that I chose, but I am very excited to see the all of the new features HTML5 uses.
